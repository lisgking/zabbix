<h2 id="dqx1relnotes__description">Description</h2>
<p>The IBM&reg; OpenAdmin
Tool (OAT) for Informix is
a web application for administering and analyzing the performance
of IBM Informix database servers. You can administer
multiple database server instances from a single OAT installation
on a web server. You can access the web server through any browser
to administer all your database servers.</p>
<p>OAT includes these
plug-ins: the IBM Informix Health Advisor Plug-in for OpenAdmin
Tool (OAT), the IBM Informix Replication Plug-in
for OpenAdmin Tool (OAT), the IBM Informix Schema Manager Plug-in
for OpenAdmin Tool (OAT), and the IBM Informix TimeSeries Plug-in
for OpenAdmin Tool (OAT). You can create additional plug-ins for OAT
to add the functions that you need.</p>
<p>For a complete list of what's
new in this release, go to <a href="http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/informix/v121/topic/com.ibm.po.doc/new_features_ce.htm" target="_blank">http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/informix/v121/topic/com.ibm.po.doc/new_features_ce.htm</a>.</p>
