<h1 id="wq2"><a href="#ToC_1">IBM OpenAdmin Tool (OAT)
for Informix</a></h1>
<p>The IBM&reg; OpenAdmin Tool (OAT)
for Informix&reg; is a web application
for administering and analyzing the performance of IBM Informix database
servers. You can administer multiple database server instances from
a single OAT installation on a web server. You can access the web
server through any browser to administer all your database servers.</p>
<p>OAT includes these optional plug-ins: the IBM Informix Health
Advisor Plug-in for OpenAdmin Tool (OAT), the IBM Informix Replication
Plug-in for OpenAdmin Tool (OAT), the IBM Informix Schema Manager Plug-in
for OpenAdmin Tool (OAT), and the IBM InformixTimeSeries Plug-in
for OpenAdmin Tool (OAT). You can create additional plug-ins for OAT
to add the functions that you need.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: OAT, the Schema Manager plug-in,
and the TimeSeries plug-in require Informix 11.10
or later. The Health Advisor plug-in requires Informix 11.50.xC7 or later. The Replication plug-in
requires Informix 11.50.xC4
or later.</p>
<h1 id="wq3"><a href="#ToC_2">Installing OAT</a></h1>
<p>The IBM OpenAdmin Tool (OAT)
for Informix is installed
by default on the supported platforms during a typical installation
of the IBM Informix Client Software Development Kit (Client
SDK) or when you install the IBM Informix software bundle and
select Client SDK or Informix Connect.
This installation program includes OAT, the Health Advisor plug-in,
the Replication plug-in, the Schema Manager plug-in, the TimeSeries
plug-in, and all necessary software to run OAT, including pre-configured
Apache, PHP, and PDO_informix. For more information, see the topics
in the Informix information
center on installing IBM OpenAdmin
Tool (OAT) for Informix with

<p>To install the OpenAdmin Tool Community Edition:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Install and set up a working web server that is configured to
serve PHP pages. For more information, see the installation notes
section following the installation instructions.
<p>For further help,
consult the web server product documentation for installation instructions,
or contact the product customer service  representatives for assistance.</p></li>
<li>Update the PHP configuration file (<span>php.ini</span>).
<ol type="a">
<li>Open the <span>php.ini </span>file for editing.
<p>If
you are using XAMPP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows: Edit the <span>php.ini</span> file in the <span>apache/bin</span> folder, <em>not</em> in the <span>php</span> folder.</li>
<li>Linux: Edit the <span>php.ini </span>file in the <span>/etc</span> folder.</li>
<li>Mac OS X: Edit the <span>php.ini </span>file in
the <span>/Applications/xampp/etc</span> folder.</li></ul>
<p>If you are not sure about the location of the correct <span>php.ini </span>configuration file, run the <strong>phpinfo()</strong> command within a PHP script on your web
server to determine the location of the correct <span>php.ini</span> file.</p></li>
<li>Add the following two lines after the <samp class="xph">extension=php_pdo.dll</samp> line
to the &quot;extension&quot; section of the configuration file:
<p></p>
<div class="lines"><samp class="xph">extension=php_pdo_informix.dll<br />
extension=php_pdo_sqlite.dll </samp><br />
</div>If these lines are
already present, remove any comment indicators from in front of them.
 
<p><strong>Important</strong>: These lines <em>must</em> follow
the <span>extension=php_pdo.dll</span>.</p></li>
<li>Modify the <span class="pk">memory_limit</span> parameter to be at least 256
MB.</li></ol></li>
<li>Install Informix Connect
or Client SDK.</li>
<li id="extract">Extract the OAT package into your
web server document root directory <samp class="xph"><var class="pv">rootdir</var>/<var class="pv">OATINSTALL</var></samp>.
For example:   
<ul>
<li>Windows: <span>C:\xampp\htdocs\oat</span></li>
<li>UNIX or Linux: <span>/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/oat</span></li>
<li>Mac OS X: <span>/Applications/xampp/htdocs/oat</span></li></ul>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> For security reasons, set
password protection for the OAT administration web pages. For more
information and an example, see "Providing password protection for
the Admin configuration pages: Apache example" in the <a href="index.php?act=help&amp;do=showDocument&amp;document=HOWTO.html">OAT
Help</a> or in the Informix information
center at <a href="http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/informix/v121/topic/com.ibm.oat.doc/ids_oat_071.htm" target="_blank">http://pic.dhe.ibm.com/infocenter/informix/v121/topic/com.ibm.oat.doc/ids_oat_071.htm</a>.</p></li>
<li><strong>UNIX, Linux, or Mac OS X users</strong>:
Change user or group ownership and permissions on the OAT directories.
      
<ol type="a">
<li>Determine which user and group run the Apache (httpd) server from
the <span>httpd.conf</span> file.</li>
<li>Change ownership for <em>each</em> OAT subdirectory
to the user and group that run the Apache (httpd) server.</li>
<li>Grant write permissions to all OAT subdirectories and files. 
 
<p>The syntax for changing the ownership and permissions is:</p>
<p><samp>chown &lt;<var class="pv">user</var>>:&lt;group> &lt;<var class="pv">OATINSTALL</var>>;
chmod +w &lt;<var class="pv">OATINSTALL</var>>;</samp></p>
<p>Where &lt;<var class="pv">OATINSTALL</var>>
is the root directory for OAT, the same directory that you used in <a href="#extract">step 4</a>.</p></li></ol></li>
<li>In the web server environment, set the INFORMIXDIR environment
variable to the Informix Connect
or Client SDK installation location. 
<ul>
<li>Windows: Click <strong>Start > Control Panel</strong>, and then click <strong>System</strong>.
In the <strong>System Properties</strong> dialog box,
click the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab, and then click <strong>Environment Variables</strong>. Add or edit the

in the shell.</li></ul></li>
<li>Start the web server.
<p>If you started the web server before modifying
the php.ini file or setting INFORMIXDIR in the environment, restart
the web server for the changes to take effect.</p></li>
<li>To start the OAT installer, go to http://<em>SERVERNAME</em>/<em>OATINSTALL</em>/install 
<p>Where:</p> 
<ul>
<li><em>SERVERNAME</em> is the name of the server where
the web server is running</li>
<li><em>OATINSTALL</em> is the location of OAT within
your web server document root directory, where you extracted the compressed
file in <a href="#extract">step 4</a>.</li></ul>
<p>For example: <samp class="xph">http://localhost/oat/install</samp></p></li>
<li>Follow the instructions in the OAT installation screens: 
<ol type="a">
<li>Read and accept the license agreement.</li>
<li>Verify that all the required PHP modules are installed. If so,
click <strong>Next</strong>; if not, check your PHP installation.</li>
<li>Modify and verify the following configuration parameters: 
<ul>
<li>LANG: Specify the default language for the application screens.</li>
<li>CONNDBDIR: Set the directory for the connections database. 
<p><strong>Important:</strong> For security purposes, specify a secure
directory for the <span>connections.db</span> file.
Do not use the web server document root directory. Additionally, ensure
that the directory in which the <span>connections.db</span> file
is located is accessible by the user who runs Apache.</p></li>
<li>BASEURL: Specify the root URL used to start OAT:  <samp>http://<span>SERVERNAME</span>/<span>OATINSTALL</span></samp>
<p>For example: <samp>http://localhost:8080/OAT</samp></p></li>
<li>HOMEDIR: Verify the directory into which you extracted the installation
package.</li>
<li>SECURESQL: Specify whether to prompt for login credentials when
using SQLToolbox.</li>
<li>INFORMIXCONTIME: Specify the number of seconds that OAT waits
to connect to the database server before returning an error.</li>
<li>INFORMIXCONRETRY: Specify the number of times that OAT attempts
to connect to the database server during the connect time specified
by INFORMIXCONTIME.</li></ul></li>
<li>To create the connections database, click <strong>Next</strong>.
The connections database is created. Click <strong>Next</strong> to
continue.</li>
<li>Select the plug-ins to install and accept the plug-in license
agreements.</li></ol></li>
<li>Optional: To access a database with a locale that is not included
in Client SDK, install the locale by using the IBM Informix International
Language Supplement (ILS). OAT requires the UTF-8 locales for all
the databases that you access through OAT. After you install OAT,
install ILS on the machine where OAT is installed, in the Informix Connect or Client
SDK directory. Use ILS to install the additional locale, including
the UTF-8 version, in the Informix Connect
or Client SDK directory that OAT is using. The database name must
be in English characters.</li>
<li>When the installation is completed, go to the OAT root URL: http://<em>SERVERNAME</em>/<em>OATINSTALL</em>.</li>
<li>On the login page, select <strong>Admin</strong> and then
expand <strong>Manage Connections</strong> to add an Informix 11.10 (or later) connection
to the default group, or to create a group.
<p>If you are using an Informix Connect or Client
SDK version before V3.0, for each new connection that you add, ensure
that there is a corresponding SQLHOSTS entry for that connection on
the web server machine.</p>
<p>To connect to a server, after a connection
is created, click <strong>Login</strong>. Click <strong>Get
Servers</strong> to retrieve the list of connections that you have created,
and then select the server.</p></li></ol>
<h2 id="wq18"><a href="#ToC_8">Uninstalling OAT after manually installing</a></h2>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: If you installed OAT with Client
SDK, see the topic in the Informix Information
Center on uninstalling OAT after installing with Client SDK. Do not
remove OAT by manually deleting the files.</p>
<p>To manually uninstall OpenAdmin Tool Community Edition, delete
the <span><var class="pv">OATINSTALL</var></span> directory.</p>
<h2 id="wq19"><a href="#ToC_9">Upgrading from a previous version of OAT</a></h2>
<p>To upgrade to OpenAdmin Tool Community Edition 3.11 from a previous
version, uninstall the old version and install the new version in
the same directory. OAT 2.20 and later preserves the connection database
information.</p>
<h1 id="wq20"><a href="#ToC_10">Installation notes</a></h1>
<p>The following section provides additional information about configuring
OAT and other support resources.</p>
<h2 id="wq21"><a href="#ToC_11">Avoiding page timeout errors</a></h2>
