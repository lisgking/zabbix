<h1 id="dqx1ids_osm"><a href="#ToC_1">Informix TimeSeries
Plug-in for OAT</a></h1>
<div>
<p>The IBM&reg; Informix&reg; TimeSeries Plug-in
for OpenAdmin Tool (OAT) provides
a graphical interface for administering database objects that are
related to a time series, including <strong>TimeSeries</strong> subtypes, containers,
and calendars.</p></div>
<div>
<div class="notetitle" id="wq2">Prerequisite:</div>
<div class="notebody">For Informix 11.50
and earlier, the IBM Informix TimeSeries DataBlade&reg; Module must
be installed and registered in the database.</div></div>
<p>A time series is a set of data that is recorded as it varies over
time. Each entry is time stamped and stored in the database. The Informix TimeSeries
extension provides the <strong>TimeSeries</strong> data type, containers, and
calendars for managing time series data.</p>
<p>With the TimeSeries plug-in,
you can monitor the database objects related to your time series:</p>
<ul>
<li>View the <strong>TimeSeries</strong> subtypes, containers, and calendars
that are used for the time series data in a database.</li>
<li>View the tables and indexes that contain <strong>TimeSeries</strong> subtypes.</li>
<li>View the virtual tables that are based on tables that contain <strong>TimeSeries</strong> subtypes.</li>
<li>Monitor the percentage of the space that is used in the containers
and in the dbspaces for the containers.</li></ul>
<p>You can also create and drop containers, calendars, and virtual
tables.</p>
<h2 id="dqx1ids_ots_001"><a href="#ToC_2">Reviewing time series</a></h2>
<div>
<p>Review database objects that are related to a time series,
including tables, indexes, and virtual tables, and <strong>TimeSeries</strong> subtypes,
containers, and calendars.</p></div>
<p>
<p>To review time series:</p>
<p>On the menu of the IBM OpenAdmin
Tool (OAT) for Informix,
click <strong>SQL ToolBox</strong> &gt; <strong>TimeSeries</strong>. A list of the databases and tables in the
database server that contain time series data is displayed.
</p>
<ul>
<li>To view information about a database or a table, click it
in the list.</li>
<li>To view more information about a specific database object
or table object, click the expand icon on the object panel.</li></ul></p>
<h2 id="dqx1ids_ots_002"><a href="#ToC_3">Creating a container</a></h2>
<div>
<p>Create a container for a time series. Create multiple containers
by specifying more than one container per dbspace or by selecting
more than one dbspace for the containers.</p></div>
<p>
<p>To create a container:</p></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>On the menu of the IBM OpenAdmin
Tool (OAT) for Informix,
click <strong>SQL ToolBox</strong> &gt; <strong>TimeSeries</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the database that contains the time series.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Actions</strong> menu, click <strong>Create
Container</strong>.</li>
<li>Complete the fields on the page.</li></ol>
<h2 id="dqx1ids_ots_003"><a href="#ToC_4">Creating a calendar</a></h2>
<div>
<p>Create a calendar to associate with a time series.</p></div>
<p>
<p>Every time series is associated with a calendar. A calendar defines a set of valid
times at which the time series can record data; it determines when
and how often entries are accepted. A calendar consists of a start
date, a pattern, and an interval. Consider
this example: the pattern start date is a Sunday; the pattern is 1
off, 5 on, 1 off; and the interval is a day. For this pattern, the
information is not gathered the first day, Sunday. Information is
gathered everyday for the next five days, Monday through Friday. Information
is not gathered the last day, Saturday.</p></p>
<p>
<p>To create a calendar:</p></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>On the menu of the IBM OpenAdmin
Tool (OAT) for Informix,
click <strong>SQL ToolBox</strong> &gt; <strong>TimeSeries</strong>.</li>
<li>Click the database that contains the time series.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Actions</strong> menu, click <strong>Create
Calendar</strong>.</li>
<li>Complete the fields on the page.</li></ol>
<h2 id="dqx1ids_ots_004"><a href="#ToC_5">Creating a virtual table</a></h2>
<div>
<p>Create a virtual table that is based on a table that contains
a <strong>TimeSeries</strong> subtype.</p></div>
<p>
<p>A
virtual table is a relational table with the same schema as the base
table, except for the <strong>TimeSeries</strong> column. The <strong>TimeSeries</strong> column
is replaced with the columns of the <strong>TimeSeries</strong> subtype. The
elements in the <strong>TimeSeries</strong> column are individual columns in
the virtual table. The virtual table contains all the data that is
in the base table, including the data that is encapsulated in the <strong>TimeSeries</strong> subtype.</p></p>
<p>
<p>To create a virtual table:</p></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>On the menu of the IBM OpenAdmin
Tool (OAT) for Informix,
click <strong>SQL ToolBox</strong> &gt; <strong>TimeSeries</strong>.</li>
<li>In the list, expand the database that contains the base
table and click the table.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Actions</strong> menu, click <strong>Create
Virtual Table</strong>.</li>
<li>Complete the fields on the page.</li></ol>
