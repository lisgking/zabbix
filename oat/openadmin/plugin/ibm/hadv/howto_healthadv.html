Advisor Plug-in for OAT</a></h1>
<div>
<p>The IBM&reg; Informix&reg; Health Advisor Plug-in
for OpenAdmin Tool (OAT) analyzes
the state of the Informix database
server. The Health Advisor plug-in gathers
information about the database server, the databases, and the operating
system, and creates a report that contains the results and recommendations.</p></div>
<div>
<div class="notetitle" id="wq2">Prerequisite:</div>
<div class="notebody">The Health Advisor plug-in requires IBM Informix 11.50.xC7
or later.</div></div>
<p>The Health Advisor plug-in includes
a series of alarms that check conditions on the database server: configuration,
Enterprise Replication (ER), operating system (OS), performance, and
storage. You can create profiles
that specify the alarms that are enabled and the thresholds for the
alarms. You can schedule a task
to run the Health Advisor with a specific profile at regular intervals. You can specify who receives an email notification
of the results. You
can also run the Health Advisor on demand on the current profile and
view the report.</p>
<h2 id="dqx1ids_oha_002"><a href="#ToC_2">Running the Health Advisor</a></h2>
